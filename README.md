Compression microscope HYU

This is a Mask R-CNN deep learning code for segmenting DIC cell images taken with a Nikon Eclipse Ti2 microscope.

Training is performed using a single A100 GPU.

The cell images were captured using a CFI Plan Apochromat VC 60X WI objective lens, and the cells used are Raji cells.

Additionally, I believe the model can be trained effectively on 40x images or images of other cell types as well.

The image shown below is a full 2048 x 2048 cell image.
